Turn your Macbook keyboard into a MIDI Controller!

## How to use
Most typical DAW has their own virtual MIDI input through computer keyboard, as a quick way to input notes - "A" to "L" would correspond to white keys and black keys above.

MIDIWRITER is a program that hijacks your keyboard input, and simulate MIDI messages. The keys have a chromatic layout with each rows offsetting the notes every 5 notes, just like a guitar fretboard! Which means a guitar player would easily adjust to the layout with minial effort.

MIDIWRITER also has layout preset for drumpad - just like launchpad :).
